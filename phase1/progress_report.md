## U-Ticket - Progress Report

### Open Question
We currently are making the class instances that can save and process information be passed through each frame so that information can be passed along, however, this seems to be quite redundant and takes a lot of effort. If more frames are added in the future, this could take much time. Especially imagining if we were actually working in the industry, the scale of a project would be much larger. How do programmers transmit data from frames to frames? We were wondering whether there could be any tips or tricks on achieving this in a more clean and convenient way?

### What Has Worked Well So Far
We illustrated our program’s functionality with the help of the GUI made, such that users can use our program easily by clicking and inputting information, to proceed with the functionality like ticket booking. 

### Individual summary
* Jasmine Zhuang \
was responsible for the implementation of flight and its 3 subclasses, part of the GUI(frames related to menu, pick flight and managers’ serialization and deserialization) and the controller(which deserializes all managers and call GUI with those restored managers as inputs), as well as everything under the UStore package(where the simple factory design pattern is used). 
For the construction of flight, I have created some helper functions, buildTime that build a LocalDateTime based on the arraylist of date information input, and buildSeatArray which returns a seat array, (a nested arraylist where each element is an arraylist of containing a seat number and its seat type), based on the information such as an arraylist of seat numbers given; these 2 helper functions are design to simplify the construction process of flight. \
* Yefan Jiang \
was responsible for adding a new feature to the class TicketManager, which enables the program to display the information of all tickets that is associated with a particular customer, so that it could be used in another class I implemented named PurchaseHistory, which gives customers an easy way to access all their purchase history in a glance, including the tickets they purchased and the items they redeemed from the U-Store. The test files for these classes are also up-to-date. Moreover, I took part in constructing the GUI application, in particular, creating a frame that shows customers the price summary before they proceed to book the ticket.
* Ryan Fang \
was responsible for implementing the login function for a user. By creating an account, the data for a new user would be stored in our user data file users.csv.  I also constructed a part of the GUI, which is related to the user login, create account, and manage account process. I already wrote some methods to read and edit our user data file, but we did not fully implement our database, so in the next phase, I will integrate all user information into users.csv and let our program edit it automatically. 
* Yunya Li \
was responsible for updating the get flights by route and get flights by time methods in the flight manager. I also updated the get seat by flight number and get flight by flight and class methods, now they would return a nested array list containing flight number and their class type. I updated the flight manager test to match all the changes in new methods. I constructed part of the GUI which related to flight routes display and was later upgraded by other teammates. I wrote a gateway method to serialize and deserialize managers but was not later used in our program.
* Chuan Liu \
was responsible for updating the ticket class by adding new features like class type to the ticket class, and adding a new class to calculate the ticket’s price according to the class type and membership level discount; and penalty for buying/refunding tickets according to the departure date compared to the local date. Also, I build part of the GUI, frame related to booking tickets(with storing tickets into customer’s purchase history, sold ticket list, add miles to customer's account...) and show the display ticket information of the ticket the customer booked. In the future, I hope we can add more functionalities like refund/change tickets, apply discounts by membership level, and beautify GUI.etc.
