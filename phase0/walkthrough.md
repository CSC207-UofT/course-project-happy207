# U-Ticket 

### Walk-through

UI prompts a user to create an account. The user can then choose to load the balance for payment. A list of available routes (departure - destination) will pop up. Next, the user needs to select their choice for a preferred route, then a list of available flights will be shown with their information containing the price for each flight. Afterward, the user needs to pick a flight number, then a list of available seats of this flight will be shown. The user is required to input the desired seat number. The UI will show the confirmation message if the userâ€™s balance is not less than the price. Finally, the system will generate a corresponding ticket and store it into TicketManager.
