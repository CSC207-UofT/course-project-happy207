#U-Ticket 

###Walk-through
UI prompts an user to create an account or login into their existing accounts. Then can choose to load balance. A list of available departures and destinations will pop up. The user inputs their choice for preferred departure and destination, then a list of available flights will be shown with their information containing price. The user picks a flight number, and then the map of available seats on this plane will then be shown. The user inputs a desired seat number. The UI will show the message “You have successfully booked the ticket for...” with the corresponding flight information. Then the system will generate a corresponding ticket and store it into TicketManager.
