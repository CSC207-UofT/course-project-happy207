###Specification

Each ticket contains information of the passenger’s name, flight number, the date and time of departure and arrival. Tickets can be modified or cancelled by users. 
By running the program, it should be able to retrieve customer’s information including names and available balances for payment, flight information including available seat maps of each flight when booking tickets. Available seats are printed as a grid of seat numbers. It could also be able to get a list of passengers of a particular flight by a flight number.
A customer can join the membership by creating an account and earn miles by purchasing tickets to take benefits of discounts. They can also change or cancel booked flights. A 10% of ticket price will be deducted from their balance if flights are changed within 24 hours of departure time.
