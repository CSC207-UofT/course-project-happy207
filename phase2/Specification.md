## Specification

This program creates a flight ticket booking system designed for booking flight tickets.​ It stores flight and customer data from user inputs to generate tickets for particular flights. 

Users will need to create an account or sign in to an existing account to book the ticket. Each customer account contains username, password and available balance and earned redeem points that can be used to purchase items in Ustore(Rewards Item Redemption System). Customers have to be a member of our company in order to redeem items from UStore. And customers can also see their purchase history which stores redeemed rewards items and tickets booked.

Each flight has its departure and arrival location and local time, distance_traveled, size of the flight(seatArray with seat number and corresponding seat class) and seat availability. There are 3 types of flight, small, medium and large which differ by their seat capacity and the number of different types of seats (“First”, “Business” and “Economy”).

Each ticket contains information about the passenger’s name, flight number,  date and time of departure and arrival, meal choice(if selected), luggage id(if there is any luggage added). In addition, tickets can be modified or canceled by users. However, fees will be applied according to the number of days away from the departure date in order to minimize unnecessary loss.

Customers would be able to load money into the account, check their purchase history, join membership, and redeem items from U-Store with reward points(there are five items to choose from). 

By running the program, customers should be able to sign-up and log-into their account and pick a flight by choosing departure and destination city and a preferable flight from a qualified flight list. Their information and choices will be saved and restored. Available seats will display in a list as well as their types so that customers can choose seats by their preference. The ticket would be successfully booked if the customer has sufficient balance in his account, and reward points of this flight would be automatically added to the customer's account. The reward points are for redeeming merchandise that are available in our U-store. It is a reward program provided to loyal customers.

On-flight meal is now available to order ahead. Multiple types of meals are offered to accommodate customers with different physical conditions and preferences. Moreover, customers now can pay for overweight luggage fees by registering luggage weight before booking tickets. Rules of penalty and fees amount will be displayed.
