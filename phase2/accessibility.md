# Accessibility

## Principle 1: Equitable Use

When logging in, password is not shown to users to enhance privacy and security.

All users share the same interface of the program.

The GUI is clearly labeled to use.

## Principle 2: Flexibility in Use

The “provide choice in method of use” rule was not implemented in our program because our program can only be run on a computer. However, in the future we could adopt this program in an android application.

Other rules are followed, for example, to Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use, we positioned all windows in the center of the entire computer screen. To ensure user-friendly accuracy and precision, we have label instructions that tells users what to do.

## Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

All text and instructions are simple and clear to accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills. 

Warnings and confirmation messages will be prompted when users make decisions.

The Layout is clear and neat to indicate a function that a user could expect.

## Principle 4: Perceptible Information

Text font is enlarged for more important and essential information.

Every visual element is clearly labeled.

However, we do not have a function that is other than visual (e.g. verbal, tactile). We may implement a word to speech function for our program in the future.

## Principle 5: Tolerance for Error

All users will be warned when they are about to make payments.

All users are allowed to return to previous pages in case they made any mistakes or decided to revert their decisions.

We provide warnings when the user input is wrong or unexpected.

## Principle 6: Low Physical Effort

All operations on this program do not need users to perform high physical effort. It only requires users to click some buttons and input some text.

We also minimized repetitive actions by linking pages in non-linear sequence. 

## Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

This principle is not applicable for our program because anyone with a normal PC should be able to run our program, regardless of their body size, posture, or mobility.

### Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

This program could be marketed toward airlines that run domestic flights within Canada because the current implementation is only suitable for domestic flights. If we implement more functions in the future, it can even be marketed toward international airlines.

### Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by people who do not read braille.

Our program is not likely to be used by people who do not live in Canada and/or do not want to take planes, since we only provide plane tickets within Canada. It is also not likely to be solely used by people without vision because our UI only has visual elements.
